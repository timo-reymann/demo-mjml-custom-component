Quick and dirty demo for mjml custom components.

# Why?

Plain mjml templates are a bit cumbersome - static properties, really?!

# How it works

Annotation processing in TypeScript simply adds the required properties.

The registration of the component is already done by the annotation, so you won't have to do it manually
